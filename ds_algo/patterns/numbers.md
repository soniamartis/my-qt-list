##Numbers
- Prime number: Divisible by itself and 1
- To find if a number is prime or not, we need to find if the number is divisible by any numbers less than or equal to its sqrt.
- If the number is not a perfect square and is not prime, eg 20, it will have a number less than its sqrt and greater than its sqrt that will multiply to give the number eg 4*5
