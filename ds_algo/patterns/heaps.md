# Heap Patterns

- To find the last node in heap array that has any children do (n/2) - 1
- A heapify function always moves downwards
- A decreaseKey/ incraesekey will always move upwards towards the parent

## How to identify its heap problem
- Kth largest/ smallest -> means a heap of K elements



### Kth largest
- In a min-heap of K elements, the element at the root is the smallest in the grp of K elements
